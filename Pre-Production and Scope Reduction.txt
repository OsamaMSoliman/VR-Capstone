Project Idea:
=============
A VR Game, where user has to do some Objectives(solve some puzzles) in a dark environment and a void a lurking monster.

My games is very similar to the classic game "Slenderman" and I have taken the idea of avoiding the light from "Senua Hellblade".


Main mechanics of the game:[doable]
===========================
1_) Randomly Generater environment. 
2_) Overall Darkness.
3_) some faint lights scatered in the world.
4_) weather (fog or rain or snow).
5_) player has the ability to summon magical light.
6_) player can summon light orbs to guide him to the nearest objective.
7_) player needs magical crystals for both of his abilities.
8_) monster is attracted to the lights.
9_) some puzzle scattered all over the environment for the player to solve.


Scope Reduction: [removed ](Mainly due to Time)
================
1_) Replaced the Puzzles with a single puzzle, user has to collect 8 pages with the help of his "guide" ability. then a ball in the sky will descend and the player has to go investigate it on his own.
2_) Kept summoning light ability "torch" without drainage consequences, just if it's on the monster will start hunting the player down.
3_) Although, I enjoyed creating the Shaders, I faced some challenges and couldn't do all I planed, the game visuals is still lacking, compared to what I had in mind. (for example, the ground was supposed to be snowy and the player would leave a trail behind).
